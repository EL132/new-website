let KnowAthensModal = "A full-stack web application built using Vue.js, Express.js, mySQL, and other technologies and frameworks. I built the application entirely independently with the exception of the design elements (I used our design team). I taught myself all the necessary skills for this project by using my resources, learning online, and asking questions to professionals. This was an invaluable project that showed me I can adapt to new technologies quickly and gave me confidence going into my next projects. Due to insufficient funding and the halting of the project, the website is no longer accessible to the public."
